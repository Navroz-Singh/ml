# Analysis of Model Improvements

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the differences between the **Base Model** and the **Improved Model**, elaborating on how changes in the architecture, training strategy, and hyperparameters contribute to better performance and robustness in the improved version.

## 1. Overview

### Base Model
- **Architecture:**
  - Embedding layer with an output dimension of 128.
  - Bidirectional LSTM with 64 units.
  - Dropout layer (rate: 0.3) to reduce overfitting.
  - A single Dense output layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- **Training:**
  - Uses the Adam optimizer.
  - Batch size of 16 and 8 epochs.
  - Does not include any advanced callbacks or learning rate adjustments.
  
### Improved Model
- **Architecture:**
  - Increased Embedding layer output dimension to 256.
  - Bidirectional LSTM with 128 units, improving the capacity for learning complex sequential patterns.
  - Lower dropout rate (0.2) in order to retain more features while still mitigating overfitting.
  - Additional Dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation along with an L2 regularization (penalty factor 0.01) to further control overfitting.
  - Final Dense layer with a sigmoid activation, similar to the base model.
- **Training Enhancements:**
  - Uses the RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, which might be more effective for certain tasks compared to Adam.
  - Increased batch size (32) and extended epoch count (20), allowing more training iterations.
  - Incorporates callbacks such as **EarlyStopping** and **ReduceLROnPlateau**:
    - **EarlyStopping**: Monitors validation loss to halt training if no improvement is seen for a few epochs, preventing overfitting.
    - **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Adjusts the learning rate when a plateau in validation loss is detected, allowing the model to fine-tune weights with smaller steps.

## 2. Detailed Change Points

### 2.1. Embedding Layer
- **Base Model:**  
  Uses an embedding dimension of **128** which encodes the textual information into a lower-dimensional space.
  
- **Improved Model:**  
  Increases the embedding dimension to **256**, offering a richer representation of words.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Higher dimensional embeddings can capture more semantic nuances and improve performance for complex tasks.
  - However, this might come at an increased computational cost.

### 2.2. LSTM Layer Configuration
- **Base Model:**  
  Implements a Bidirectional LSTM with **64 units**.
  
- **Improved Model:**  
  Doubles the LSTM units to **128**, enabling the model to capture more complex temporal dependencies.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Enhanced capacity to model sequential information.
  - Potential for better understanding of longer-term dependencies in text data.

### 2.3. Regularization Techniques
- **Base Model:**  
  Uses a single **Dropout** layer with a dropout rate of **0.3** after the LSTM layer.
  
- **Improved Model:**  
  Reduces dropout rate slightly to **0.2** after the LSTM layer.  
  Additionally, it introduces an intermediate **Dense layer** with:
  - **64 units**
  - **ReLU activation**
  - **L2 Regularization (0.01)**
  
  **Impact:**  
  - Lower dropout potentially allows the network to retain more useful features.
  - The added Dense layer with L2 regularization helps to penalize overly complex models, further reducing overfitting while enhancing non-linearity.
  
### 2.4. Optimizer and Learning Rate Adjustments
- **Base Model:**  
  Uses **Adam optimizer** with default parameters.
  
- **Improved Model:**  
  Switches to **RMSprop** with a learning rate of **0.001**.  
  **Impact:**  
  - RMSprop can sometimes yield better performance in recurrent neural networks by adapting the learning rate to each parameter.
  - The change in optimizer may lead to more stable training dynamics depending on the dataset specifics.

### 2.5. Training Parameters and Callbacks
- **Base Model:**
  - **Batch Size:** 16
  - **Epochs:** 8
  - No callbacks used.
  
- **Improved Model:**
  - **Batch Size:** 32  
    - Allows more samples per update, which can stabilize gradient descent.
  - **Epochs:** 20  
    - More epochs provide additional opportunity to optimize the loss, though risk of overfitting is managed via callbacks.
  - **Callbacks:**  
    - **EarlyStopping:** Monitors validation loss with a patience of 3 epochs. Stops training once no improvement is noted, thus saving computation and preventing overfitting.
    - **ReduceLROnPlateau:** Monitors validation loss to reduce the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 if performance plateaus, allowing the model to fine-tune more precisely.
  
  **Impact:**  
  - These dynamic adjustments during training enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process, preventing unnecessary training and adapting the learning rate for a fine-grained optimization.

## 3. Summary of Improvements

- **Enhanced Representational Power:**  
  The increase in embedding size and LSTM units provides a richer and more detailed representation of the input text.

- **Better Regularization:**  
  Reducing dropout slightly and introducing L2 regularization in an added dense layer improves the balance between model complexity and generalization.

- **Dynamic Training Adjustments:**  
  The switch to RMSprop and the integration of EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks lead to a more adaptive training process that can converge more effectively and avoid overfitting.

- **Overall Impact:**  
  These cumulative changes yield a model that is more capable of capturing complex patterns in data, while being more resilient to overfitting and adaptive to training challenges. The improved training strategy likely leads to more stable and higher test accuracy performance.

## Conclusion

The improved model makes meaningful upgrades over the base model by enhancing representation capacity, adjusting regularization techniques, adopting a more adaptive optimizer, and incorporating smart training callbacks. Together, these changes aim to provide a balanced approach to achieving high accuracy without sacrificing generalization in unseen data.
